#      5 or 6, but not both. Here is a sample run of this program:
#     Enter an integer: 10 Is 10 divisible by 5 and 67 False
#       Is 10 divisible by 5 or 6? true Is 10 divisible by 5 or 6, but not both? True

#  Q15__ Write a Python program which displays an appropriate name for a person, using a combination of nested ifs and compound conditions. Ask the user for a gender, first name, last name and age.
