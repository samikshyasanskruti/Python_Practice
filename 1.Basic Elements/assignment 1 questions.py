##Q09 How does the effect of the following two statements differ?
#     a. overline x += x + 10
#     b. x = x + 1

##Q10 Write a program that asks the user to enter the width and length of a room. Once these values have been read,
#      your program should compute and display the area of the room. The length and the width will be entered as floating-point numbers.
#      Include units in your prompt and output message; either feet or meters, depending on which unit you are more comfortable working with.



##Q 11 An online retailer sells two products: widgets and gizmos. Each widget weighs 75 grams. Each gizmo weighs 112 grams. Write a program that
#       reads the number of widgets and the number of gizmos from the user. Then your program should compute and display the total weight of the parts.

##Q12 Write a program that determines how quickly an object is travelling when it hits the ground. The user will enter the height from which the object is 
#     dropped in meters (m). Because the object is dropped its initial speed is 0 m/s. Assume that the acceleration due to gravity is 9.8m / (s ^ 2) You can 
#     use the formula v_{f} = sqrt(v_{i} ^ 2 + 2ad) to compute the final speed, v_{f} when the initial speed, v_{i} acceleration, a, and distance, d, are known.

##Q 13 Write a program that reads a four-digit integer from the user and displays the sum of its digits. For example, if the user enters 3141 then your program should
#       display 3+1+4 +1=9.

##Q 14 Write a program that reads three integers from the user and displays them in sorted order
#      (from smallest to largest). Use the min and max functions to find the smallest and largest values. The middle value can be found by computing the sum of all three
#      values, and then subtracting the minimum value and the maximum value.

##Q 15 Create a program that reads duration from the user as number of days, hours, minutes, and seconds. Compute and display the total number of seconds represented by this duration.
